SimpleRSA
=========

A very basic implementation of the RSA algorithm in C. Right now, the program only generates the primes up to a user input n using the sieve of Erastothenes.

If pulling this repository, also be sure to grab the BitVector implementation from another of my repos and place it according to the relative path in rsa.c, or change that path. (Or implement your own BitVector, I guess.)
